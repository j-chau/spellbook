# SpellBook

A React App that searches through the [Open5e](https://open5e.com/)  API and returns spells that can be added to a D&D player's deck.

[[Live Demo]](https://j-chau.github.io/spellbook/)

## Features

- Dynamically displays spells as cards from the Open5e API, with information on spell level, duration, range, required materials, etc.
- Search by keyword or filter by class or school of magic; filters persist on refresh
- Save or remove spells, and saved spells can be viewed in "My Spells"
